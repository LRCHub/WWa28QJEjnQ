[00:07.39] You ought to know that
[00:10.33] I think we're one and the same
[00:12.89] I don't think we could help it
[00:16.06] No, don't think we could help it
[00:20.27] We don't talk much
[00:23.52] Guess 'cause nothing has changed
[00:26.09] And I'm not sure I like it
[00:29.17] And I'm so tired of fighting
[00:43.17] 
[00:32.60] If I told you, you'd know how to
[00:35.52] Go and break my heart in two
[00:39.10] 'Cause I wouldn't anyways
[00:42.33] We'd end up like always
[00:45.90] You know me, you better show me
[00:48.57] That you can say it to my face
[00:52.33] 'Cause you know we're the same
[00:55.63] There's worse things I can take
[01:11.13] 
[01:06.35] I know you hate it
[01:09.41] When there's nothing to say
[01:11.91] I'm not quite sure we'd fix it
[01:15.45] Guess we're so used to it
[01:19.60] Wish I'd known this from the beginning
[01:25.05] We find it hard to work out
[01:28.43] Why we have all this doubt
[01:41.43] 
[01:31.57] If I told you, you'd know how to
[01:34.61] Go and break my heart in two
[01:38.34] 'Cause I wouldn't anyways
[01:41.62] We'd end up like always
[01:44.94] You know me, you better show me
[01:47.62] That you can say it to my face
[01:51.64] 'Cause you know we're the same
[01:54.69] There's worse things I can take
