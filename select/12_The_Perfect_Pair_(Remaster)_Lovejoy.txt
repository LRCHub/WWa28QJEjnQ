Ought to know that I, I think we're one and the same
Don't think we could help it, no, don't think we could help it
We don't talk much, I guess 'cause nothing has changed
And I'm not sure I like it, and I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways, we'd end up like always
But you know me, better show me, you better say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I could take

I know you hate it when there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure we'd fix it, I guess we're so used to it
Wish I had known this from the beginning
We'd find it hard to work out, why we have all this doubt

If I told you, that you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways, we'd end up like always
But you know me, better show me, you better say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I could take
