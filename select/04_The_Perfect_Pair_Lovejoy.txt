Ought to know that
I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it
No, I don't think we could help it
We don't talk much
I guess 'cause nothing has changed
And I'm not sure I like it
And I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you
That you'd know how to
You'd go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways
We'd end up like always
But you know me
You better show me
You better say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

I know you hate it
When there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure wе'd fix it
I guess we're so usеd to it
Wish I had known this
From the beginning
We'd find it hard to work out
Why we have all this doubt

If I told you
That you'd know how to
You'd go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways
We'd end up like always
But you know me
You better show me
You better say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take
